Hello. 

I am a Masters student at Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science pursuing the Intelligent Information Systems program offered by the Language Technology Institute. I'm currently working with Professor Jamie Callan and Zhuyun Dai on the topic of Weak supervision of neural search engines. 

My research interests are in the areas of machine learning, deep learning and information retrieval. Previously, I have worked on machine translation and topic modelling. 

I completed my undergraduate study in BITS Pilani University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in English Studies.
